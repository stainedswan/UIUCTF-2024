    Thanks for looking at our writeups.
    I put a lot of time into formatting them! :)


## From the [UIUCTF 2024 website](https://2024.uiuc.tf/)

> UIUCTF is an annual capture-the-flag competition hosted by SIGPwny, the cybersecurity club at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).

## Scenario

A massive outage is affecting the entire transit system! The SIGPwny Transit Authority has issued an emergency call to CTF teams for help with restoring service. Solve challenges to fix stations and deliver as many passengers as you can!

## Format

- Jeopardy
- 48 hours
- Unlimited team size
  - Dynamic scoring
- The flag format is uiuctf{[a-zA-Z0-9_&-]+}

The competition will run from:
2024-06-29 00:00 UTC
to
2024-07-01 00:00 UTC.

## Rules

    Don't cheat.

    Each person can only compete on one team. Sharing flags or solves between teams will lead to immediate disqualification.
    Don't attack the infrastructure.

    This includes brute-force attacks and tools that can generate excessive amounts of traffic, such as nmap, dirbuster, etc. unless otherwise specified.
    No flag hoarding or flag dumping!

    It's not cool. We require teams to submit flags as they find them.

Also, don't do anything orange and below on the [CTF tactics iceberg](https://twitter.com/gf_256/status/1206393845497376768/).
