# Team Info

Our team, `example.com`, consists of 5 members, one has done some CTFs previously and the others are either beginners or beginner-intermediate. We all have a background in computer science/engineering or electrical engineering and we thought this would be a fun summer activity.

<b>Thank you for looking at our writeups and for a great CTF! ðŸŽ‰</b>

<b>I put a lot of time into formatting them. This is my first time writing writeups for any CTF, although I've participated in many before. :) </b>

## From the [UIUCTF 2024 website](https://2024.uiuc.tf/)

> UIUCTF is an annual capture-the-flag competition hosted by SIGPwny, the cybersecurity club at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).

## Scenario

A massive outage is affecting the entire transit system! The SIGPwny Transit Authority has issued an emergency call to CTF teams for help with restoring service. Solve challenges to fix stations and deliver as many passengers as you can!

## Format

- Jeopardy
- 48 hours
- Unlimited team size
- Dynamic scoring
- The flag format is uiuctf{[a-zA-Z0-9_&-]+}

The competition will run from:
2024-06-29 00:00 UTC
to
2024-07-01 00:00 UTC.

## Rules

- Don't cheat.
- Each person can only compete on one team. Sharing flags or solves between teams will lead to immediate disqualification.
- Don't attack the infrastructure.
- This includes brute-force attacks and tools that can generate excessive amounts of traffic, such as nmap, dirbuster, etc. unless otherwise specified.
- No flag hoarding or flag dumping!
- It's not cool. We require teams to submit flags as they find them.

Also, don't do anything orange and below on the [CTF tactics iceberg](https://twitter.com/gf_256/status/1206393845497376768/).
